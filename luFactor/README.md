Folder Contains luFactor.m
  Matlab Function to calculate the LU factorization given a square matrix. 
  
  Partial pivoting of rows is used. 

## function [L,U,P] = luFactor(A)
Note: To see results you must type  [L,U,P] = luFactor(A)
### input:
* A: input square matrix. 

### output:
* L = lower triangular matrix
* U = upper triangular matrix
* P = pivot matrix
